# Coupon_Redemption

Problem Statement: The goal is to improve the effectiveness of company's coupon campaigns by
predicting the likelihood of coupon redemption by the customers. The objective is to develop a
model that can accurately predict which customer are most likely to redeem a coupon and
optimize the coupon distribution process to increase the conversion rate of the campaign. This
can help companies to target their promotions more effectively, increase customer engagement
and ultimately drive sales.

Description: The dataset includes information on coupons offered to customers in 18 campaigns,
campaign details, coupon-item mapping, customer demographics, customer transaction data and
item information. The goal is to predict the probability for the next 10 campaigns in the test set
for each coupon and customer combination, weather the customer will redeem the coupon or
not?
